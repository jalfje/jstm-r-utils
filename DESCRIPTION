Description: This package is a bundle of miscellaneous functions that I've used
    (and sometimes re-used, but not always) that I thought would be helpful to
    have in a package, so that they are more easily accessible from different
    computers, projects, and R sessions, compared to my previous practice of
    copying and source-ing from a hardcoded filepath.
